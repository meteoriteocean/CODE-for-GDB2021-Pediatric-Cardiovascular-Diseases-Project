# README

This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the figures presented in the manuscript.

**Key Information:**

*   **Data:** Processed data files used for generating the main figures are included in the `data_processed` directory.
*   **Figure Generation:** The script `Figure X.R` generates the main figures.(You might need to adjust the file paths within the scripts to match your specific file directory structure.)
*   **R Environment:** The code and associated R packages have been updated to be compatible with R version 4.5.1.

**Instructions for Use:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
	*   To ensure proper functioning, begin by executing the `0 Install and load package.R` script. This script installs and loads all necessary R packages. Please ensure you have the required permissions to install packages on your system.

2.  **Reproducing Figures:**
	*   After successfully running the environment setup script, open and run the `Figure.R` script. This script will utilize the data files found in the `data_processed` directory to generate the figures presented in the manuscript.

**File Structure:**

*   `0 Install and load package.R`: Installs and loads required R packages.
*   `Figure.R`: R script for generating the main figures.
*   `data_processed/`: Directory containing the processed data files. 

**Important Notes:**

*   Please ensure that you have R version 4.5.1 installed on your system.
*   If you encounter any issues, please double-check that all required packages have been installed successfully and that you are running the scripts in the correct order.
*   For further details on the data processing and figure generation, please refer to the main manuscript.
